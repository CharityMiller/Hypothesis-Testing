# Hypothesis-Testing
Using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, I will explore alternative questions to challenge the data and it's statistical significance. 

Job Satisfaction vs Longevity. Usually we have a common belief that if an employee is with a company for an extended period of time (3+ years), then they are satisfied with the company. I want to bring an alternative view to the table and say that just because an employee is with a company for an extended period of time, it doesn't mean they are satisfied with the company. With a p-value of 0.2317 and a significance level of 5%, results proved the data is not normally distributed.
